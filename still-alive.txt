Couldn't be with you on this night
when the moon started to fight
the mood is expression to be full of circuitry
any other couldnt get me
he is all i wish inside
he is all i know i find
swallows me whole, still alive
never shattered all my pride

where is the difference between us
i know you like a bird knows the bees
i see you in passing
i adore where you  go to
to the flowers
to pollinate
maybe your a cheerleader
ready for stunts
maybe you have armor
and can shed it for moment
to let me look through
